Imagine an operating system that combines elegance, performance and user friendly experience, where your computer becomes a canvas for your digital creations.

* **Blazing-Fast Performance:** AxOS is designed to make your hardware sing.!
* **User friendly:** AxOS uses the KDE Plasma environement. It will be easy to use, and you won't need to use command lines thanks to preinstalled app store and must-have apps.
